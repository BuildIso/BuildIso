# Knowing if the .exe is legitimate

No, when you run a .exe, it is still not recommended to run unknown executables,
because there is no protection when running them except for antivirus programs that detect threats in real time.

# Is the .exe file in this repository legitimate?

Even I, as a developer and director of this project, do not recommend launching it with administrator rights, even though it usually has no consequences, except in cases where you are in protected folders of your projects. In that case, you have two options: 
Option A): Move your working folder containing BuildIso.exe to a non-protected folder, for example: C:\YourOS 
Option B): Run it with administrator rights (not recommended because it has not been tested).
When you launch or download the executable BuildIso.exe, make sure the link is indeed https://github.com/BuildIso/BuildIso (active) or https://github.com/htmluser-hub/BuildIso (archived).
The only official BuildIso site is https://buildiso.com
